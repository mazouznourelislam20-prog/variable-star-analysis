# Variable Star Light Curve

This is a small learning project about variable stars.

The goal of the project is simple:  
to plot the brightness of a star over time and see how it changes.

I used real astronomical data and Python to load the data and create a light curve.

I am a beginner in programming, so I did not focus on writing complex code.
Instead, I focused on:
- understanding what a light curve represents
- working with real data
- fixing errors and learning step by step

AI tools were used to help me understand the code and correct mistakes during development.

This project was made as part of my preparation for studying physics and astronomy.
